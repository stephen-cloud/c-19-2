### Work

**Architect, Rue Gilt Groupe, Boston, MA: December 2015 to April 2020 (layoff) | on-line retail**

Overhauled applications posing the highest risk to our 24x7 website. Mostly reused existing application code on better platforms. Good at not boiling the ocean and enabling incrementally deployable improvements. 

An example is something called “ESB.” It was based on an end-of-life server platform that consistently proved a challenge to update and deploy. It became the moniker given to any software that currently wasn’t working. Led project to replace the broken things. Proof of success is that it’s easy to work on and doesn’t break the website nowadays.

As Data Science Architect single-handedly built repeatable, very high-performance (16ms), 100% cloud-native REST APIs from scratch for customer-facing personalization. Everything scales horizontally as a fundamental, including serverless, DynamoDB NoSQL, and dozens of other AWS managed services. This work is recognized as a key competitive advantage for Rue Gilt. 

Thought leader for software engineering best practices. Like modern languages and frameworks, serverless, managed services, horizontal scalability, microservices, and NoSQL vs. Relational. All this with guardrails disguised as guidance. In addition, I created an Architect’s “Contract” with the rest of technology so they know what to expect from me and where they fit in. People seem to like it.
